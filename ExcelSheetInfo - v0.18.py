So, now I need to to play the part os the best valuation analyst ever.

I'm presenting a Balance Sheet extracted from an excel file in the following format:
Value (the actual value of the cell) - Coordinates (the cell reference, that in excel would represent Row/Column)

I need you to create a condense balance sheet populating the following table just for December 2022. Present de information as a table next to each items:

Cash
Accounts Receivable
Inventory
Other Current Assets
Total Current Assets

Property plants and equipment
Goodwill & Other Indefinite-Lived Intangibles
Intangibles
Other Long Term Assets
Total Lont term Assets
Total Assets

Accounts Payable
nAccured Liabilites
Short Term Debt
Defeferred Revenue
Other Current Liabilites
Total Current Liabilities
Ling Term Debt
Other Long Term Liabilities
Total Long Term Liabilities
Total Liabilities
Equity
Total Liab&Equity


If some calculations need to be done, don't present the result bue the calculations being made using this as a guidance:
* Current assets = '2022 BS'!D9 + '2022 BS'!D10 ==>This is just an example
* Calcualtion's column value need to start with an = sign
* This need to be representes asi BS'!AB22AB24+BS'!AB22AB25+BS'!AB22AB26
* Total Liab&Equity shoulb be equal to Total Assets
* CAlculations column should match value column
    


----------------------
Dear AI. You are a valuation analyst preparing a cap. table for a company. It's name will be super secret.

The values are presented in the following structure from a list object:
Key: Value  that contains the actual value of the cell 
Value: Coordinates (the cell reference, that in excel would represent Row/Column)

Using the information below from an excel I need you to populate a table with the following structure. Please create a table.
Make this security by security and not investor by investor:

Security Name | Shares Issued and Outstanding | Issue Price/Strike Price/Price per share | Shares Issued and Outstanding Cell Reference 

Clarifications:
* Cell reference should refer to shares issued and outstanding
* In the case of options please condense them based on their issue price and oustanding number.
* "formats the Cell Reference to be copied and pasted into excel"
* "issued and outstanding shares" is not the same as "fully diluted shares"
